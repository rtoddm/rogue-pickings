## My process

1. I began by initializing my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/rtoddm/git-repo-gallery).
2. Then I configured my repository to publish my code to a web address (GitHub pages).
3. I looked through the designs in order to plan how I'd tackle the project. This step is important to help you think through potential CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. However, before worrying about any styles, I structured my HTML content.
5. I then wrote out the basic styles for my project such as `font-family` and `font-size`, etc.
6. Then I started adding CSS styles to the top of the page and worked down.
7. I then worked on the JavaScript for the website.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project gave me practice with JavaScript functionality. This project reinforced the fact that consistently working with JavaScript and the logic needed for a project to work correctly is necessary to understand and retain your ability to write functional JavaScript.

### Continued development

In the future I plan on working more on my JavaScript so I can more readily create functionality on my sites.
