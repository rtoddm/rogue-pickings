## Overview

This is a project that I completed which allowed me to build a responsive website with HTML, CSS, and Flexbox.

## My process

1. I began by initializing my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/rtoddm/rogue-pickings).
2. Then I configured my repository to publish my code to a web address (GitHub pages).
3. I looked through the designs in order to plan how I'd tackle the project. This step is important to help you think through potential CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. However, before worrying about any styles, I structured my HTML content.
5. I then wrote out the basic styles for my project such as `font-family` and `font-size`, etc.
6. Then I started adding CSS styles to the top of the page and worked down making sure that I designed the site "mobile first" in order to successfully build it as a responsive website over multiple devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The biggest benefit I gained from completing this project was better understanding responsive web development.

### Continued development

In the future I plan on working more on my JavaScript so I can more readily create functionality on my sites.
